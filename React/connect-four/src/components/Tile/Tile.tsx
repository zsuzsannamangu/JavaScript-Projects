//This code defines a React component called Tile, which is responsible for rendering a tile that may contain a "chip" of either a red or yellow color based on a property (chipType).

import React from "react";
import classNames from "classnames"; //import classnames package = npm install classnames. This package simplifies the process of dynamically assigning multiple classes to HTML elements based on certain conditions.
import styles from "./Tile.module.css"; //An import from a CSS Module (.Tile.module.css). CSS Modules allow you to locally scope CSS, meaning class names defined in this file are unique to this component and won't conflict with other CSS on the page.
import {Props} from "./types"; //A TypeScript import that defines the structure of the props (data) that the Tile component will receive.
//We attached the Props interface to the React.PureComponent definition; This is how you type React class
export default class Tile extends React.PureComponent<Props> { //A PureComponent automatically optimizes rendering by implementing a shallow comparison of props and state. This means that the component will only re-render if it detects changes in props or state.
    render() { //The render method returns JSX that defines how the Tile component should look on the screen.
        const { id, chipType, onClick = () => {} } = this.props; //if not provided, it defaults to an empty function () => {}
        const chipCssClass = classNames(styles.chip, chipType === "red" ? styles.red : styles.yellow); //This line dynamically assigns class names to the chip inside the tile using the classnames package. If chipType is red the class styles.red applied, otherwise styles.yellow

        return ( //onClick={() => onClick(id)} ensures that when the tile (styles.tile) is clicked, the onClick function is called with the tile's id.
            <div className={styles.tile} onClick={() => onClick(id)}>
                {chipType && <div className={chipCssClass} />}
            </div> //{chipType && <div className={chipCssClass} />}: This checks if chipType is defined. If it is, it renders another div with the class chipCssClass, which applies the appropriate styling for the chip's color (either red or yellow).
            //&& in JavaScript is a conditional rendering shortcut, if the first is true returns the second operand, otherwise, it returns the first operand
        );
