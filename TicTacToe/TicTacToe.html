            <p>Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two 
                players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
                The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
                or diagonal row is the winner. </p>
            <p>Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool 
                for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence 
                that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program 
                to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the 
                state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game 
                tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by 
                both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.</p>
